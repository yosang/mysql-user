# Method 1
Use `show databases`, there should be a database called `mysql` in the list. Switch to it using `use mysql`.

Use `show tables`, there should be a table called `user` in the list. Use `DESCRIBE user` to get a view of the columns of this table.

Get the current users by querying the first two columns by using `SELECT host, user FROM user`.

To delete a user, you simply delete the record.

The changes wont take effect until we do `FLUSH PRIVILEGES`

# Method 2
Theres a simpler less manual way as the example above, just simply run
```sql
DROP USER 'dbuser'@'localhost';
```

Then do `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`
