## DATABASE

To create a database we simply use the following command
```sql
CREATE DATABASE myNewDB;
```

## USER
Once the database has been created, we now need to create a user and grant permissions to it, we can do that with the following command:

```sql
CREATE USER 'dbUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongPw';
```

## PRIVILEGES
Once the database AND the user exists, we can now grant privileges on it so that next time we log in as that user, we can actually use the database.

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON myNewDB.* TO 'dbUser'@'localhost';
```

We can also specify the access

```sql
GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, REFERENCES, DELETE ON myNewDB.* TO 'dbUser'@'localhost';
```

Its verbose, but gives more control.
The `.*` represent all the tables inside the database, we can specify the tables here aswell if we want

## LOG IN
Run `mysql -u dbUser -p`, enter the password and check the database that this user has access to with `SHOW DATABASES;`
