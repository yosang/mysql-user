Using the mysql-cli, we can log in as root with the following command `mysql -u root -p`.

We want to make sure the password policy is set to a security level that fits our needs.

We can see the configuration by using `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%password%'` and look for  `validate_password.`policy and `validate_password.length` adjust these accordingly with the following command:

`SET GLOBAL validate_password.policy = MEDIUM;`
`SET GLOBAL validate_password.length = 8;`

Once thats done, move on to the next step.
